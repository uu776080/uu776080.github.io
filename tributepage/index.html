    <li><b>1990</b> - Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson received the IEEE Richard W. Hamming Medal from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), "for the origination of the UNIX operating system and the C programming language"</li>
    <li><b>1997</b> - Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson were made Fellows of the Computer History Museum, "for co-creation of the UNIX operating system, and for development of the C programming language"</li>

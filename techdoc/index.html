    <header><h2>Introduction</h2></header>
    <p>In GNU/Linux and other Unix-like operating systems, files are organized into directories. 
    All files and directories are arranged in one big tree rooted at "/". It's called a tree because 
    if you draw the filesystem, it looks like a tree but it is upside down.</p>
    <p>These files and directories can be spread out over several devices. mount(8) serves to attach 
    the filesystem found on some device to the big file tree. Conversely, umount(8) detaches it again. 
    On recent Linux kernels, mount(8) with some options can bind part of a file tree somewhere else or 
    can mount filesystem as shared, private, slave, or unbindable. Supported mount options for each 
    filesystem are available in "<b>/usr/share/doc/linux-doc-*/Documentation/filesystems/</b>".</p>
    <p>Directories on Unix systems are called folders on some other systems. Please also note that 
    there is no concept for <b>drive</b> such as "<b>A:</b>" on any Unix system. There is one filesystem, and everything 
    is included. This is a huge advantage compared to Windows.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Unix_file_basics">
    <header><h2>Unix file basics</h2></header>
    <p>Here are some Unix file basics.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Filenames are case sensitive. That is, "<b>MYFILE</b>" and "<b>MyFile</b>" are different files.</li>
      <li>The <b>root directory</b> means root of the filesystem referred as simply "/". 
      Don't confuse this with the home directory for the root user: "<b>/root</b>".</li>
      <li>Every directory has a name which can contain any letters or symbols <b>except "/"</b>. The root 
      directory is an exception; its name is "/" (pronounced "slash" or "the root directory") and it cannot be renamed.</li>
      <li>Each file or directory is designated by a <b>fully-qualified filename</b>, <b>absolute filename</b>, or <b>path</b>, 
      giving the sequence of directories which must be passed through to reach it. The three terms are synonymous.</li>
      <li>All <b>fully-qualified filenames</b> begin with the "/" directory, and there's a "/" between each directory or file in the 
      filename. The first "/" is the top level directory, and the other "/"'s separate successive subdirectories, until we reach 
      the last entry which is the name of the actual file. The words used here can be confusing. Take the following <b>fully-qualified 
      filename</b> as an example: "<b>/usr/share/keytables/us.map.gz</b>". However, people also refers to its basename "us.map.gz" alone as a filename.</li>
      <li>The root directory has a number of branches, such as "<b>/etc/</b>" and "<b>/usr/</b>". These subdirectories in turn branch into still 
      more subdirectories, such as "<b>/etc/init.d/</b>" and "<b>/usr/local/</b>". The whole thing viewed collectively is called the <b>directory tree</b>. 
      You can think of an absolute filename as a route from the base of the tree ("/") to the end of some branch (a file). You also hear people 
      talk about the directory tree as if it were a <b>family</b> tree encompassing all direct descendants of a single figure called the root 
      directory ("/"): thus subdirectories have <b>parents</b>, and a path shows the complete ancestry of a file. There are also relative paths 
      that begin somewhere other than the root directory. You should remember that the directory "<b>../</b>" refers to the parent directory. 
      This terminology also applies to other directory like structures, such as hierarchical data structures.</li>
      <li>There's no special directory path name component that corresponds to a physical device, such as your hard disk. This differs from 
      RT-11, CP/M, OpenVMS, MS-DOS, AmigaOS, and Microsoft Windows, where the path contains a device name such as "<b>C:\</b>". (However, directory entries 
      do exist that refer to physical devices as a part of the normal filesystem.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Filesystem_internals">
    <header><h2>Filesystem internals</h2></header>
    <p>Following the <b>Unix tradition</b>, the Debian GNU/Linux system provides the filesystem under which physical data on hard disks
     and other storage devices reside, and the interaction with the hardware devices such as console screens and remote serial consoles 
     are represented in an unified manner under "<b>/dev/</b>".</p>
    <p>Each file, directory, named pipe (a way two programs can share data), or physical device on a Debian GNU/Linux system has a data 
    structure called an inode which describes its associated attributes such as the user who owns it (owner), the group that it belongs 
    to, the time last accessed, etc. The idea of representing just about everything in the filesystem was a Unix innovation, and modern 
    Linux kernels have developed this idea ever further. Now, even information about processes running in the computer can be found in the filesystem.</p>
    <p>This abstract and unified representation of physical entities and internal processes is very powerful since this allows us to 
    use the same command for the same kind of operation on many totally different devices. It is even possible to change the way the 
    kernel works by writing data to special files that are linked to running processes.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Filesystem_permissions">
    <header><h2>Filesystem permissions</h2></header>
    <p>Filesystem permissions of Unix-like system are defined for three categories of affected users.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The <b>user</b> who owns the file (<b>u</b>)</li>
      <li>Other users in the <b>group</b> which the file belongs to (<b>g</b>)</li>
      <li>All <b>other</b> users (<b>o</b>) also referred to as "world" and "everyone"</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For the file, each corresponding permission allows following actions.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The <b>read</b> (<b>r</b>) permission allows owner to examine contents of the file.</li>
      <li>The <b>write</b> (<b>w</b>) permission allows owner to modify the file.</li>
      <li>The <b>execute</b> (<b>x</b>) permission allows owner to run the file as a command.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For the directory, each corresponding permission allows following actions.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The <b>read</b> (<b>r</b>) permission allows owner to list contents of the directory.</li>
      <li>The <b>write</b> (<b>w</b>) permission allows owner to add or remove files in the directory.</li>
      <li>The <b>execute</b> (<b>x</b>) permission allows owner to access files in the directory.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Here, the execute permission on a directory means not only to allow reading of files in that directory but also to allow viewing 
    their attributes, such as the size and the modification time.</p>
    <p>ls(1) is used to display permission information (and more) for files and directories. When it is invoked with the "<b>-l</b>" option, 
    it displays the following information in the order given.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Type of file</b> (first character)</li>
      <li>Access <b>permission</b> of the file (nine characters, consisting of three characters each for user, group, and other in this order)</li>
      <li><b>Number of hard links</b> to the file</li>
      <li>Name of the <b>user</b> who owns the file</li>
      <li>Name of the <b>group</b> which the file belongs to</li>
      <li><b>Size</b> of the file in characters (bytes)</li>
      <li><b>Date and time</b> of the file (mtime)</li>
      <li>Name of the file</li>
    </ul>

  <section class="main-section" id="Control_of_permissions_for_newly_created_files:_umask">
    <header><h2>Control of permissions for newly created files: umask</h2></header>
    <p>What permissions are applied to a newly created file or directory is restricted by the umask shell builtin 
    command. See dash(1), bash(1), and builtins(7).</p>
    <code>(file permissions) = (requested file permissions) & ~(umask value)</code>
    <p>The Debian system uses a user private group (UPG) scheme as its default. A UPG is created whenever a new user is added 
    to the system. A UPG has the same name as the user for which it was created and that user is the only member of the UPG. 
    UPG scheme makes it safe to set umask to 0002 since every user has their own private group. (In some Unix variants, it is 
    quite common to setup all normal users belonging to a single users group and is a good idea to set umask to 0022 for security in such cases.)</p>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Permissions_for_groups_of_users_(group)">
    <header><h2>Permissions for groups of users (group)</h2></header>
    <p>In order to make group permissions to be applied to a particular user, that user needs to be made a member of the group 
    using "<b>sudo vigr</b>" for <b>/etc/group</b> and "<b>sudo vigr -s</b>" for <b>/etc/gshadow</b>. You need to login after logout (or run "<b>exec newgrp</b>") 
    to enable the new group configuration.</p>
    <p>The hardware devices are just another kind of file on the Debian system. If you have problems accessing devices such as CD-ROM 
    and USB memory stick from a user account, you should make that user a member of the relevant group.</p>
    <p>Some notable system-provided groups allow their members to access particular files and devices without <b>root</b> privilege.</p>
    <p>List of notable system-provided groups for file access</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>dialout</b> -- full and direct access to serial ports ("<b>/dev/ttyS[0-3]</b>")</li>
      <li><b>dip</b> -- limited access to serial ports for <b>Dialup IP</b> connection to trusted peers</li>
      <li><b>cdrom</b> -- CD-ROM, DVD+/-RW drives</li>
      <li><b>audio</b> -- audio device</li>
      <li><b>video</b> -- video device</li>
      <li><b>scanner</b> -- scanner(s)</li>
      <li><b>adm</b> -- system monitoring logs</li>
      <li><b>staff</b> -- some directories for junior administrative work: "<b>/usr/local</b>", "<b>/home</b>"</li>
    </ul>
    <p>See passwd(5), group(5), shadow(5), newgrp(1), vipw(8), vigr(8), and pam_group(8) for management commands of the user and group system.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Timestamps">
    <header><h2>Timestamps</h2></header>
    <p>There are three types of timestamps for a GNU/Linux file.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>mtime</b> -- the file modification time (<b>ls -l</b>)</li>
      <li><b>ctime</b> -- the file status change time (<b>ls -lc</b>)</li>
      <li><b>atime</b> -- the last file access time (<b>ls -lu</b>)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Overwriting a file changes all of the <b>mtime</b>, <b>ctime</b>, and <b>atime</b> attributes of the file.</p>
    <p>Changing ownership or permission of a file changes the <b>ctime</b> and <b>atime</b> attributes of the file.</p>
    <p>Reading a file changes the <b>atime</b> attribute of the file on the historic Unix system.</p>
    <p>Reading a file changes the <b>atime</b> attribute of the file on the GNU/Linux system if its filesystem is mounted with "<b>strictatime</b>".</p>
    <p>Reading a file for the first time or after one day changes the <b>atime</b> attribute of the file on the GNU/Linux system 
    if its filesystem is mounted with "<b>relatime</b>". (default behavior since Linux 2.6.30)</p>
    <p>Reading a file doesn't change the <b>atime</b> attribute of the file on the GNU/Linux system if its filesystem is mounted with "<b>noatime</b>".</p>
    <p>Use touch(1) command to change timestamps of existing files.</p>
    <p>For timestamps, the <b>ls</b> command outputs different strings under non-English locale ("<b>fr_FR.UTF-8</b>") from under the old one ("<b>C</b>").</p>
    <code>$ LANG=fr_FR.UTF-8  ls -l foo<br>-rw-rw-r-- 1 penguin penguin 0 oct. 16 21:35 foo
    <br>$ LANG=C  ls -l foo<br>-rw-rw-r-- 1 penguin penguin 0 Oct 16 21:35 foo</code>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Links">
    <header><h2>Links</h2></header>
    <p>There are two methods of associating a file "<b>foo</b>" with a different filename "<b>bar</b>".</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hard links</li>
      <ul><li>Duplicate name for an existing file</li><li>"<b>ln foo bar</b>"</li></ul>
      <li>Symbolic link or symlink</li>
      <ul><li>Special file that points to another file by name</li><li>"<b>ln -s foo bar</b>"</li></ul>

    <p>See the following example for changes in link counts and the subtle differences in the result of the <b>rm</b> command.</p>
    <code>$ umask 002<br>$ echo "Original Content" > foo<br>$ ls -li foo<br>1449840 -rw-rw-r-- 1 penguin penguin 17 Oct 16 21:42 foo<br>

    $ cat bar<br>Original Content<br>$ cat baz<br>New Content</code>
    <p>The "." directory links to the directory that it appears in, thus the link count of any new directory starts at 2. 
    The ".." directory links to the parent directory, thus the link count of the directory increases with the addition of new subdirectories.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Named_pipes_(FIFOs)">
    <header><h2>Named pipes (FIFOs)</h2></header>
    <p>A named pipe is a file that acts like a pipe. You put something into the file, and it comes out the other end. 
    Thus it's called a FIFO, or First-In-First-Out: the first thing you put in the pipe is the first thing to come out the other end.</p>
    <p>If you write to a named pipe, the process which is writing to the pipe doesn't terminate until the information being written is 
    read from the pipe. If you read from a named pipe, the reading process waits until there is nothing to read before terminating. 
    The size of the pipe is always zero --- it does not store data, it just links two processes like the functionality offered by the 
    shell "<b>|</b>" syntax. However, since this pipe has a name, the two processes don't have to be on the same command line or even be run 
    by the same user. Pipes were a very influential innovation of Unix.</p>
    <p>For example, try the following</p>
    <code>$ cd; mkfifo mypipe<br>$ echo "hello" >mypipe & # put into background<br>[1] 8022<br>$ ls -l mypipe<br>
    prw-rw-r-- 1 penguin penguin 0 Oct 16 21:49 mypipe<br>$ cat mypipe<br>hello<br>[1]+  Done                    echo "hello" >mypipe<br>
    $ ls mypipe<br>mypipe<br>$ rm mypipe</code>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Sockets">
    <header><h2>Sockets</h2></header>
    <p>Sockets are used extensively by all the Internet communication, databases, and the operating system itself. It is similar to the 
    named pipe (FIFO) and allows processes to exchange information even between different computers. For the socket, those processes do 
    not need to be running at the same time nor to be running as the children of the same ancestor process. This is the endpoint for the 
    inter process communication (IPC). The exchange of information may occur over the network between different hosts. The two most common 
    ones are the Internet socket and the Unix domain socket.</p>
    <p>"<b>netstat -an</b>" provides a very useful overview of sockets that are open on a given system.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Device_files">
    <header><h2>Device files</h2></header>
    <p>Device files refer to physical or virtual devices on your system, such as your hard disk, video card, screen, or keyboard. 
    An example of a virtual device is the console, represented by "<b>/dev/console</b>".</p>
    <p>There are 2 types of device files.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Character device</li>
      <ul><li>Accessed one character at a time</li>
          <li>1 character = 1 byte</li>
          <li>E.g. keyboard device, serial port, …</li></ul>
      <li>Block device</li>
      <ul><li>accessed in larger units called blocks</li>
          <li>1 block > 1 byte</li>
          <li>E.g. hard disk, …</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>You can read and write device files, though the file may well contain binary data which may be an incomprehensible-to-humans 
    gibberish. Writing data directly to these files is sometimes useful for the troubleshooting of hardware connections. For example, 
    you can dump a text file to the printer device "/dev/lp0" or send modem commands to the appropriate serial port "/dev/ttyS0". But, 
    unless this is done carefully, it may cause a major disaster. So be cautious.</p>
    <p>The device node number are displayed by executing ls(1) as the following.</p>
    <code>$ ls -l /dev/sda /dev/sr0 /dev/ttyS0 /dev/zero<br>brw-rw---T  1 root disk     8,  0 Oct 16 20:57 /dev/sda<br>
    brw-rw---T+ 1 root cdrom   11,  0 Oct 16 21:53 /dev/sr0<br>crw-rw---T  1 root dialout  4, 64 Oct 16 20:57 /dev/ttyS0<br>
    crw-rw-rw-  1 root root     1,  5 Oct 16 20:57 /dev/zero</code>
    <ul>
      <li>"<b>/dev/sda</b>" has the major device number 8 and the minor device number 0. This is read/write accessible by users 
      belonging to the <b>disk</b> group.</li>
      <li>"<b>/dev/sr0</b>" has the major device number 11 and the minor device number 0. This is read/write accessible by users 
      belonging to the <b>cdrom</b> group.</li>
      <li>"<b>/dev/ttyS0</b>" has the major device number 4 and the minor device number 64. This is read/write accessible by users 
      belonging to the <b>dialout</b> group.</li>
      <li>"<b>/dev/zero</b>" has the major device number 1 and the minor device number 5. This is read/write accessible by anyone.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>On the modern Linux system, the filesystem under "<b>/dev/</b>" is automatically populated by the udev(7) mechanism.</p>

    <header><h2>procfs and sysfs</h2></header>
    <p>The procfs and sysfs mounted on "<b>/proc</b>" and "<b>/sys</b>" are the pseudo-filesystem and expose internal data structures of the 
    kernel to the userspace. In other word, these entries are virtual, meaning that they act as a convenient window into the 
    operation of the operating system.</p>
    <p>The directory "<b>/proc</b>" contains (among other things) one subdirectory for each process running on the system, which is named 
    after the process ID (PID). System utilities that access process information, such as ps(1), get their information from this 
    directory structure.</p>
    <p>The directories under "<b>/proc/sys/</b>" contain interfaces to change certain kernel parameters at run time. (You may do the same 
    through the specialized sysctl(8) command or its preload/configuration file "<b>/etc/sysctl.conf</b>".)</p>
    <p>People frequently panic when they notice one file in particular - "<b>/proc/kcore</b>" - which is generally huge. This is 
    (more or less) a copy of the content of your computer's memory. It's used to debug the kernel. It is a virtual file that points to 
    computer memory, so don't worry about its size.</p>
    <p>The directory under "/sys" contains exported kernel data structures, their attributes, and their linkages between them. 
    It also contains interfaces to change certain kernel parameters at run time.</p>

  <section class="main-section" id="tmpfs">
    <header><h2>tmpfs</h2></header>
    <p>The tmpfs is a temporary filesystem which keeps all files in the virtual memory. The data of the tmpfs in the page cache on 
    memory may be swapped out to the swap space on disk as needed.</p>
    <p>The directory "<b>/run</b>" is mounted as the tmpfs in the early boot process. This enables writing to it even when the 
    directory "/" is mounted as read-only. This is the new location for the storage of transient state files and replaces several 
    locations described in the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard version 2.3:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>"<b>/var/run</b>" → "<b>/run</b>"</li>
      <li>"<b>/var/lock</b>" → "<b>/run/lock</b>"</li>
      <li>"<b>/dev/shm</b>" → "<b>/run/shm</b>"</li>
    </ul>

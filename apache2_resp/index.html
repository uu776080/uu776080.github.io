<h4 class="pnk">It works!</h4>
<p>This is the default welcome page used to test the correct operation
   of the Apache2 server after installation on Debian systems. If you 
   can read this page, it means that the Apache HTTP server installed 
   at this site is working properly. You should <b>replace this file</b> 
   (located at <code>/var/www/html/index.html</code>) before continuing to operate 
   your HTTP server.
</p>
<p>If you are a normal user of this web site and don't know what 
  this page is about, this probably means that the site is currently 
  unavailable due to maintenance. If the problem persists, please 
  contact the site's administrator.
</p>
<h4>Configuration Overview</h4>
<p>Debian's Apache2 default configuration is different from the 
  upstream default configuration, and split into several files optimized
  for interaction with Debian tools. The configuration system is <b>
  fully documented in /usr/share/doc/apache2/README.Debian.gz</b>. 
  Refer to this for the full documentation. Documentation for the web 
  server itself can be found by accessing the <a href="/manual">manual</a>
  if the <code>apache2-doc</code> package was installed on this server.
</p>
<p>The configuration layout for an Apache2 web server installation on 
  Debian systems is as follows:
</p>
<pre>
  etc/apache2/
|-- apache2.conf
|       `--  ports.conf
|-- mods-enabled
|       |-- *.load
|       `-- *.conf
|-- conf-enabled
|       `-- *.conf
|-- sites-enabled
|       `-- *.conf

</pre>
<ul>
  <li><code>apache2.conf</code> is the main configuration file. It puts the pieces 
  together by including all remaining configuration files when 
  starting up the web server.</li>
  <li><code>ports.conf</code> is always included from the main configuration file. 
  It is used to determine the listening ports for incoming 
  connections, and this file can be customized anytime.</li>
  <li>Configuration files in the <code>mods-enabled/</code>, <code>conf-enabled/</code> and 
  <code>sites-enabled/</code> directories contain particular configuration snippets
  which manage modules, global configuration fragments, or virtual 
  host configurations, respectively.</li>
  <li>They are activated by symlinking available configuration files 
  from their respective *-available/ counterparts. These should be 
  managed by using our helpers <code>a2enmod, a2dismod, a2ensite, a2dissite,</code>
  and <code>a2enconf, a2disconf</code>. See their respective man pages for 
  detailed information.</li>
  <li>The binary is called apache2. Due to the use of environment 
  variables, in the default configuration, apache2 needs to be 
  started/stopped with <code>/etc/init.d/apache2</code> or <code>apache2ctl</code>. <b>Calling 
  <code>/usr/bin/apache2</code> directly will not work</b> with the default 
  configuration.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Document Roots</h4>
<p>
  By default, Debian does not allow access through the web browser 
  to <em>any</em> file apart of those located in <code>/var/www</code>,
  <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_userdir.html">public_html</a> 
  directories (when enabled) and <code>/usr/share</code> (for web applications). 
  If your site is using a web document root located elsewhere (such as 
  in <code>/srv</code>) you may need to whitelist your document root directory in 
  <code>/etc/apache2/apache2.conf</code>.</p>
<p>The default Debian document root is <code>/var/www/html</code>. You can make 
  your own virtual hosts under <code>/var/www</code>. This is different to previous 
  releases which provides better security out of the box.</p>
<h4>Reporting Problems</h4>
<p>Please use the <code>reportbug</code> tool to report bugs in the Apache2 package
   with Debian. However, check 
   <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?ordering=normal;archive=0;src=apache2;repeatmerged=0">
   existing bug reports</a> before reporting a new bug.</p>
<p>Please report bugs specific to modules (such as PHP and others) to 
  respective packages, not to the web server itself.</p>
